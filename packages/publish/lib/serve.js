/**
 * `awt site serve` — the dev server, run the one way that keeps the shadow honest.
 *
 * The build itself is Quartz's, and the command is not hard to type:
 *
 *     cd site/.quartz-src && node quartz/bootstrap-cli.mjs build \
 *       -d ../../docs/wiki -o ../public --serve --port 8080 --wsPort 3001
 *
 * What is hard to remember is that **the index has to be emitted immediately
 * before it**. `awt site publish` does that; a hand-typed serve command did not, so a
 * dev build compared the rendered pages against whatever `.awt-index.json` was
 * last written — which after any edit is a disagreement that is not real. This
 * subcommand exists so the two cannot come apart; the emitting happens in `cli`,
 * before this is called.
 *
 * **`--serve`, always.** A build without it is publish mode, which resolves
 * cross-wiki links to their published URLs rather than to localhost, and Quartz
 * emits extensionless URLs that only the dev server serves.
 *
 * **Ports live in the project, not in the command.** A wiki keeps the same pair
 * every time it is served — a bookmark that breaks between runs is not a bookmark,
 * and two wikis have to be servable at once for cross-wiki links to resolve — so
 * `awt.config.mjs` carries them and `awt site serve` with no arguments is the whole
 * command. A flag still wins, for a one-off second server.
 *
 * **A configured port is used, whatever it is.** Which range a project should pick
 * from is a question about that project's machine, and the answer belongs where
 * the project is being set up — the `wiki-docs` skill carries it. A tool that
 * refused a number the project had already written down would be overruling a
 * decision it was not present for.
 *
 * It refuses to build over `site/release` for the same reason `publish` refuses
 * to build over `site/public`: a build in the wrong mode rewrites every
 * cross-wiki link and every page still returns 200.
 *
 * **It also refuses to start on a port somebody already holds**, because Quartz
 * does not. Quartz prints `Started a Quartz server listening at …` and *then*
 * `Port 8100 is already in use`, so the success line comes first and the port
 * answers 200 throughout — from whatever was already bound. When that is a stale
 * server on the same wiki it is hot-reloading the same files, so every page looks
 * current and correct and is not your build. Quartz does exit 1 honestly, but
 * trimming its output through `tail` makes the shell report the pipe's status and
 * the 1 becomes 0. Asked and answered before the build starts instead.
