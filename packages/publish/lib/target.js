/**
 * The target a release is built for: a base, a mount and a wiki name.
 *
 *     https://example.org/docs/  +  shelton/  +  photo-cli/
 *     http://localhost:8088/wikis/  +  shelton/  +  photo-cli/
 *     base (the deployment)           mount       name
 *
 * The base is the deployment's, subpath included; the mount groups a project's wikis; the
 * name is the wiki's own. A release is built for exactly one address, and hosting the wiki
 * somewhere else is a publish for that target, which is why nothing in the output has to
 * be location-independent.
 *
 * WHERE THE THREE COME FROM. Flags win over the declaration: `--base`, `--mount`, `--name`
 * over `site.baseUrl`, `site.mount`, and `site.self` for the name. A project that declares
 * `site.baseUrl` and no mount is the target it always was: the release is served at the base
 * itself. A mount makes the structured form, and a structured form needs a name.
 *
 * `site.baseUrl` has always been a host with no scheme, and `https` was assumed. It still
 * is, when none is written. A scheme is honoured when given, because a local target served
 * over plain http would otherwise write `https://localhost:8088/…` into every sitemap, feed
 * and `og:` tag.
