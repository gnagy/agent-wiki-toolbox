/**
 * `awt site publish --watch`: a release that keeps itself current while someone edits.
 *
 * It is the same build as a one-shot publish, for the same target, kept resident. Quartz holds
 * every parsed note in memory under `--watch` and re-parses only the file that changed, which
 * is what takes a rebuild from about four seconds to about half of one; there is no
 * incremental publish to build, only a process to keep alive.
 *
 * WATCH IS NOT SERVE. `--serve` also writes dev links and starts an HTTP server, and neither
 * is wanted here: the links are the target's, as in any release, and a static server in front
 * of the release directory does the serving. That Quartz can watch without serving is the
 * point; that the plugin took its links from `--serve` is why it needed the target option.
 *
 * QUARTZ BUILDS INTO A WORK DIRECTORY, AND THE RELEASE IS A COPY OF IT. Quartz wipes its output
 * directory when it starts and rewrites files one by one on every rebuild, so a reader of that
 * directory sees the site vanish for the first build and a mix of old and new pages during each
 * one. Each completed build is therefore copied beside the release and swapped into place by a
 * rename, which is what a one-shot publish does with its staging directory. A rebuild that
 * fails leaves the standing release alone.
 *
 * THE PUBLISHED SITE THIS REPLACES IS KEPT ONCE. The first swap keeps what stood as a hidden `-prev` beside it,
 * like a one-shot publish. Later swaps do not rotate it: a previous release that is only the
 * last rebuild is no rollback at all, and the one from before the session is the one worth having.
 *
 * AN INCREMENTAL STATE CAN GO WRONG IN WAYS A COLD BUILD DOES NOT. Deleting a note that others
 * link to makes every later incremental rebuild fail the toolbox's resolver check, under
 * `awt site serve` as well, because Quartz goes on resolving links to a page it no longer has.
 * A cold build of the same notes passes. So a failed rebuild restarts the build from scratch,
 * which is what a person would do, and a build that dies, as one with a fatal error in a note
 * does, starts again at the next change to the notes.
