/**
 * Every operation the toolbox has, as one subcommand of the one binary. Names are
 * `splitByHeading` in the library, `split_by_heading` on the MCP surface and
 * `split` here.
 *
 * A command is data: a name, one line of summary, a usage string, how many
 * arguments it takes, an option map for `parseArgs`, and a `run`. `awt --help` is
 * generated from that list, so every command is listed. Two optional fields shape
 * the surface rather than the call: `group` puts a command under a `GROUPS` entry
 * and it is then invoked as `awt <group> <name>`, and `section` is the heading it
 * is listed under.
 *
 * `positionals` is a count, or `'any'` for the three that are open-ended. It is
 * declared rather than inferred because an unexpected argument was silently
 * dropped by four commands — `awt check ../other-wiki` checked this one and said
 * nothing — and a count a command states is also a count a test can read.
 *
 * The CLI is not a mirror of the packages. `move` here is `moveNote`,
 * `renameNote` or `moveNotes` depending on what it is given, `site index` is a
 * `core` function grouped by what consumes it, and the MCP surface stays flat
 * with its own names.
