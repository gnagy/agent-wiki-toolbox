#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Record what a session did to a wiki, so the Stop hook knows what to format and
# whether the graph is worth checking. Writes nothing but its own state.
#
# Three signals, because they earn different treatment at Stop:
#
#   .touched  anything at all happened, and the wiki root it happened in
#   .files    paths a file tool wrote, known exactly -- safe to format
#   .opaque   a shell command may have written notes we cannot name -- report only
#
# The distinction between the last two is the point. Formatting a path this
# session wrote is a fix; formatting the whole wiki because a shell command was
# seen would rewrite notes the session never opened. The first is done at Stop,
# the second is only reported.
#
# MCP verb calls set .touched alone. They serialise what they write, so there is
# nothing to format; but a delete can leave links dangling, so the graph moved.
#
# Fails open by design: anything wrong here lets the session continue.
