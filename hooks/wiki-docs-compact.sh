# Give the agent back the list of notes it edited, after compaction took it away.
#
# The touch record already knows which notes this session wrote -- it is what the
# Stop hook formats and what decides whether the graph is worth checking. That
# record lives in a file and survives compaction untouched. What does not survive
# is the agent's own memory of having written them, and the two disagreeing is the
# failure: the Stop hook formats a file the agent no longer knows it touched, and
# the agent, asked what it changed, has the wrong answer.
#
# So on `SessionStart` with source `compact`, read the record back out and inject
# it. Nothing is recomputed and nothing is written; this hook only says out loud
# what the session already recorded.
#
# `SessionStart` cannot use an `mcp_tool` hook -- servers have not connected when
# it runs -- which is why this is a command hook like the mandate beside it.
#
# Fails open by design: a session that comes out of compaction with no list is a
# session that formats nothing at Stop, not a session that breaks. Bash 3.2.
