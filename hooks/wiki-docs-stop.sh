# Format what the session wrote and check the graph before the session ends.
#
# Why Stop and not PostToolUse: a hook that formats after every Write changes the
# file under the agent and breaks the next Edit. At Stop the agent is done, so a
# rewrite costs nothing -- but only of files this session actually wrote, which
# is what wiki-docs-touch.sh records. A shell command that may have written notes
# we cannot name is reported, never silently reformatted: the blast radius of a
# whole-wiki fmt is every note, and the session opened a handful.
#
# The graph half is `awt check`. Problems block the stop and come back as the
# list; placeholders, orphans and dead ends do not -- the distinction check
# already draws, and the one a session must not be held hostage to.
#
# The schema half asks the same file list one more question. It used to run only
# in the opaque-write branch, so an ordinary session that edited front matter had
# nothing checking its schemas before it ended -- and `awt frontmatter` reports a
# violation rather than refusing the write precisely because a single write is not
# the unit a schema applies to. This is where that lands instead, and it covers
# every route in: a verb, an Edit, a Write. One `fmt --dry-run` over the list
# rather than one call per file, and it is the same plugin either way, so the two
# cannot disagree.
#
# Fails open by design: anything wrong here lets the session end. Bash 3.2, which
# is what macOS ships, so no mapfile and no associative arrays.
