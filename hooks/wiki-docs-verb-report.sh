# Deliver what a structural verb would not do, and put the index back in step.
#
# The four verbs that move notes -- `move`, `rename`, `split_by_heading` and
# `merge_files` -- each return a report carrying two lists:
#
#   skipped     files that changed underneath the verb, so it refused to overwrite
#               them; re-running finishes what it left
#   unresolved  links it would not guess at -- an ambiguous stem, a stub naming no
#               single child, a relative link that already pointed at nothing
#
# Both are in the tool result already. "Read the return value" is a rule the agent
# follows or does not, and the cost of not following it is a rewrite that looks
# complete. This hook makes the two lists arrive on their own, as
# `additionalContext`, which `PostToolUse` was measured to deliver.
#
# The same run regenerates the listing, because each of these four changes the set
# of notes or the paths they sit at, and the index table stops matching the wiki
# the moment one lands. A regenerated index is appended to the session's touch
# record, so the Stop hook formats it like anything else the session wrote rather
# than leaving `awt fmt --dry-run` dirty.
#
# A dry run is a preview the agent asked for: the lists still arrive, nothing is
# written, and the index is left alone.
#
# Fails open by design: anything wrong here lets the session continue. Bash 3.2,
# which is what macOS ships, so no mapfile and no associative arrays.
