# Keep a published wiki current: when the agent stops, rebuild the release if a note is newer than it.
#
# Why Stop: it is the one point at which the agent is done with a batch of edits. PostToolUse would
# publish half-finished work after every write, and SessionEnd would leave a wiki stale for as long as
# a session stays open. Stop fires after every turn, not once a session, which is why the staleness
# test and the lock live in `awt site publish --if-stale`: a turn that wrote nothing costs one process
# start, and one that did triggers one build.
#
# Never a first publish. `--if-stale` does nothing for a wiki with no release for its target, so a
# project opts in by publishing once by hand; a hook is not the place to pick an address.
#
# The build runs in the background so the hook returns at once, and its output goes to a log under
# the temp directory named for the project, since nothing is watching it: a build that fails
# otherwise fails silently, and is retried at the next stop until it is fixed.
#
# Runs beside wiki-docs-stop.sh, not after it, so a note that script reformats on the way out can be
# newer than the release this one builds; the next stop publishes it. Fails open, like that script.
