/**
 * awt — the toolbox inside a Quartz build. One plugin, both a transformer and an
 * emitter, and everything it does comes from reading the toolbox's index as data.
 *
 * It replaced four plugins that read the same file the same way, and were wired
 * into every project separately: a change to any of them meant a change to every
 * wiki's config. Now the toolbox writes the one entry that names this package
 * into the config it derives for a build, and a project's own files say nothing
 * about it. Quartz allows the merge outright: `quartz.category` may be a list,
 * the loader puts the package into each matching bucket and calls the default
 * factory once per bucket, and checks only that the instance *has* the methods
 * that bucket needs. So two instances of this exist during a build, one asked
 * for `markdownPlugins`/`htmlPlugins` and one for `emit`, and each reads the
 * index for itself. That is cheap, and it is also the only correct shape: above
 * 128 files Quartz parses in a worker pool and hands each worker a structured
 * clone, so nothing shared between instances would survive anyway.
 *
 * THE INDEX IS READ, NEVER RECOMPUTED. Every fact below — a note's address, the
 * headings on a page, what a link resolves to — is decided in `core` and carried
 * in `.awt-index.json`. Recomputing any of it here would be a second
 * implementation free to disagree, and the failure mode is a link that renders and
 * points somewhere wrong. `awt site serve` and `awt site publish` emit the index
 * immediately before the build; a build started any other way has to run
 * `awt site index` first. `awt site serve` also re-emits it after every edit, so
 * the file is re-read whenever it changes: Quartz keeps one plugin instance for
 * the life of a dev server, and an index read once would be the pre-edit one
 * for every rebuild after.
 *
 * A MISSING INDEX IS AN ERROR, ONE POLICY, EVERYWHERE. Four plugins had three
 * answers to that file being absent — refuse, warn, stay silent — and the reasoning
 * for the silent one held only while all four were enabled together, which two of
 * the four wikis on the machine this was written on were not. Comparing against a
 * stale index is the same error: it reports disagreements that are not real and
 * hides ones that are. The staleness check runs once, in the emitter, where the
 * whole tree is in view.
 *
 * UNDER `awt site serve`, STALE MEANS "WAIT", NOT "FAIL". A save reaches Quartz's
 * watcher and the one `awt site serve` re-emits the index from, and which of them
 * finishes first is not decided anywhere. So when the server was started with
 * `AWT_INDEX_FOLLOWS` set — which says an index is on its way — every read waits,
 * synchronously and for a bounded time, until the index is at least as new as the
 * notes; only then, if it still is not, does the emitter throw. Synchronously
 * because Quartz calls `markdownPlugins` synchronously, and the transformer needs
 * the new index to put a new folder note at its address. Blocking Quartz's thread
 * blocks nothing that writes the index: that is a different process.
 *
 * ZERO DEPENDENCIES. Quartz symlinks a local plugin directory into
 * `.quartz/plugins/` and imports it from there, so a bare specifier would have to
 * resolve from outside the Quartz tree. `fs` and `path` are the whole import list,
 * and the cross-wiki reference grammar is restated rather than imported from
 * `syntax`; `packages/publish/test/cross-wiki-agreement.test.js` holds the two
 * together.
 *
 * WHAT EACH HALF DOES
 *
 * Transformer, markdown pass:
 *   - Folder notes. A note beside a folder of its own name is that folder's
 *     landing page, at the address the index gives it. `file.data.slug` moves so
 *     emitters write the page there, FolderPage sees the folder already has a
 *     landing page, and the navigation trie carries the note's title with its
 *     address. `ctx.allSlugs` does NOT move: CrawlLinks matches link text against
 *     the last segment of each slug, and a moved entry's last segment is `index`.
 *   - Cross-wiki references. `[text](prefix:path.md#anchor)` becomes the URL the
 *     target wiki actually serves, read from that wiki's own `contentIndex.json`
 *     and never computed. Which registry address is used comes from the `target`
 *     option `awt` derives with the config (`ctx.argv.serve` for a hand-wired one):
 *     a dev server links to registry `dev` bases, a publish build to `published`
 *     ones. Everything unresolvable is a warning, never a failure, because a wiki
 *     has to build before the wikis it depends on have ever been built.
 *
 * Transformer, html pass:
 *   - The second half of folder notes. CrawlLinks resolves to the slug it matched,
 *     so a link to a moved note comes out one segment too shallow; a host trying
 *     `$uri/index.html` still finds the page and then serves it under a URL from
 *     which every relative asset resolves against the parent folder. The trailing
 *     slash goes back on the finished href, whatever link syntax produced it. This
 *     has to be an html pass: Quartz runs every transformer's markdown pass over
 *     every file before any html pass runs, so the slug is settled site-wide by
 *     the time the first href is read. It must run after CrawlLinks, which is
 *     what the order the toolbox writes (61, above crawl-links' 60) is for.
 *
 * Emitter:
 *   - `static/awtHeadings.json`: every published page's heading anchors, keyed by
 *     served address beside the file path, mirroring `contentIndex.json` so a
 *     consumer reads both the same way. It is what lets another wiki check a
 *     cross-wiki reference that carries an anchor.
 *   - The shadow (toolbox-decisions 10). Two resolvers currently compute where
 *     every link goes — Quartz's `crawl-links` at the hast layer, the toolbox's at
 *     the source layer — and this compares them page by page and fails the build
 *     when they disagree. The point is not that ours is right: it is that the
 *     incumbent validates the replacement across real edits and real Quartz bumps
 *     before anything is switched off. It is an emitter so the report covers the
 *     whole wiki rather than dying on the first page. `shadow: false` is the
 *     resolver switch, when its gate is met; the check goes and nothing else moves.
